              In order to obtain your refund, contact customer service by phone
              and obtain an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number to place
              on your package. Write this number on the outside of the shipping
              package, and send the product back to our fulfillment center at the
              address listed below, within thirty (30) days of the date you
              originally ordered the product. In order for your refund to be

              thirty (30) days of the original purchase date. You pay for return
              shipping. This fee will be taken out of the refund issued. Once our
              fulfillment center has received the package and relayed the correct
              information to us, you will be issued a refund. Your refund will be
              credited back to your bank account, and may take up to 3-5 business
              days to show in your statement, depending on the speed of the

              If you provide us with insufficient or incorrect information your
              refund will be delayed. Once a refund has been approved please allow
              for up to 10 days for the refund to be applied. Depending on the
              bank that issues the credit card, your refund can take up to ten
